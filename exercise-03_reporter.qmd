# Reporter Gene Expression

## Introduction

[**NEEDS TEXT HERE**]

::: { .callout-important }
In this part of the workshop, you will plot the ratio of your reporter absorbance (OD700) to your organism growth (OD600) against the concentration of antibiotic applied, using `R`, in order to identify good candidate reporters.
:::

## Load and inspect your data

Your data is in the file `reporter_curves.csv`, so load it into `R` using the `read.csv()` function, and inspect the format of your data, just as you did for the yeast growth data in @sec-yeast-expt.

```{webr-r}
# Use read.csv() to load your data
# Use glimpse() or head() to inspect the format of your data

```

::: { .callout-warning collapse="true" }
## Help! I'm stuck!

Use the `R` code below to load your data

```r
data <- read.csv("reporter_curves.csv")
glimpse(data)
```
