# Reporter Gene Expression

As part of BM214 laboratories 1-3 you constructed a biosensor capable of detecting an antibiotic. You isolated a strain containing a plasmid containing a pigmented _chromoprotein_, which you then cloned as a _reporter gene_ downstream of candidate antibiotic-responsive promoters (@fig-reporter-expt).

In this part of the workshop, you will use `R` to plot absorbance ratio curves for a set of nine candidate promoter sequences (plus a control!), each challenged with an antibiotic at concentrations from 0-10 $\mu$g, in the browser.

## Use what you know from BM110, BM211, and @sec-yeast-expt

You have met `R` before in the statistics component of BM110, in an interactive exercise as [part of a BM211 workshop](https://sipbs-compbiol.github.io/BM211-workshops/shannon_index.html), and in an earlier part of this workshop (@sec-yeast-expt).

Full instructions for how to generate your figures are provided as part of the workshop.
