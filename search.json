So check the box marked Search and classify.\nThe default settings (95% minimum sequence identity, reporting ten neighbours) are a good starting point.\nOnce you select Search and classify, a new set of options will appear in the window (Figure 1.10) and these can also be left as they are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.10: silva’s default Search and classify options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.4 Run the silva search\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer: Running the silva search\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the Run Tool button (lower right of Figure 1.10).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nsilva does not provide results as quickly as NCBI’s BLAST server.

Many of the topics you may meet later in your degree - phylogenetic, pharmacokinetics, microbial genomics, and so on - are supported by packages in R designed specifically for those subjects, and can make your work much easier. Also, skills in R are highly sought-after by industrial and other employers.
