The base layer is a declaration of the dataset, and which variables in the dataset will be used to draw the figure.\nWhen you inspected your dataset in the WebR cell above, you will have seen that there are three variables in the dataset:\n\ntime (the time in hours after the experiment started at which the measurement was taken)\nOD600 (the absorbance measurement)\nmedium (the liquid medium in which the yeast were grown)\n\nWe want to plot this data in the following way:\n\ntime should extend along the \\(x\\)-axis from left to right to indicate the progression of the experiment\nOD600 should extend up the \\(y\\)-axis to indicate how much light was absorbed by the yeast at each timepoint\nmedium will be used to separate datapoints into distinct curves in the graph\n\nTo declare the base dataset, we can create a ggplot() object, specifying the dataset we will be using (the data argument), and the variables to be used along the x and y axes in the aesthetics aes() argument:\n\nfig &lt;- ggplot(data, aes(x=time, y=OD600))  # Declare the dataset/base layer\n\nThe fig variable we create this way has a single layer, this data declaration. It does not yet have any visualisation or graphics. To generate a plot, we must add a new layer - a geometry layer, such as geom_point():\n\nfig &lt;- ggplot(data, aes(x=time, y=OD600)) +  # Declare the dataset/base layer\n         geom_point()  # Add a marker for each datapoint\n\ngeom_point() will add a visualisation layer to the plot, but we won’t be able to see it until we tell R to show us the figure. We can do this in a number of ways, such as with a print() statement:\n\nfig &lt;- ggplot(data, aes(x=time, y=OD600)) +  # Declare the dataset/base layer\n         geom_point()  # Add a marker for each datapoint\n\n# Show the figure\nprint(fig)\n\nor just using the variable name\n\nfig &lt;- ggplot(data, aes(x=time, y=OD600)) +  # Declare the dataset/base layer\n         geom_point()  # Add a marker for each datapoint\n\n# Show the figure\nfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nUse the WebR cell below to visualise your data with a basic plot.\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure you generate probably won’t look very impressive (Figure 2.2). The datapoints are all there and, because we know that there are three growth curves we can - as humans - interpret the data accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: A basic ggplot() graph of three growth curves. There is much room for improvement.\n\n\n\nThere are nice things about this figure. The axis labels have already been added, and the gridlines help orient the viewer to the actual data values. But we can’t really see which datapoints belong to which media, or to which curves. We might want to improve this in a few ways:\n\ncolour the datapoints by medium\nfit a line through the datapoints so we can see the growth curve trends\nuse a semilog (logarithmic \\(y\\)-axis) plot\n\nWe will go through all these improvements, below.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Colouring datapoints by medium\nTo colour our data representation by a variable, we assign that variable to the color argument when setting up the plot aesthetics:\n\nfig &lt;- ggplot(data, aes(x=time, y=OD600, color=medium))  # Colour data by the medium\n\nDoing this with our plot code above:\n\nfig &lt;- ggplot(data, aes(x=time, y=OD600, color=medium)) +  # Declare the dataset/base layer\n         geom_point()  # Add a marker for each datapoint\n\n# Show the figure\nfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nUse the WebR cell below to visualise your data using colour to separate data points by growth medium.\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure you generated now clearly shows which datapoint belongs to which growth curve (Figure 2.3). ggplot2 has automatically added a legend to the plot, and the data is much more interpretable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: A ggplot() graph of three growth curves, with growth medium indicated by colour.\n\n\n\nThis is obviously an improvement, but we still have things that we want to do to make the plot better:\n\nfit a line through the datapoints so we can see the growth curve trends\nuse a semilog (logarithmic \\(y\\)-axis) plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Fit a model to the data\nOne of the things that makes R so powerful is the ready availability of many statistical tools, including the ability to fit statistical models to datasets.\nThe ggplot2 package provides a layer called geom_smooth() which allows us to fit a model to each curve in our dataset. By default geom_smooth() uses a method called loess to estimate a best fit to the data. You can add this layer using the code below:\n\nfig &lt;- ggplot(data, aes(x=time, y=OD600, color=medium)) +  # Declare the dataset/base layer\n         geom_point() + # Add a marker for each datapoint\n         geom_smooth()  # Fit a default curve to the data\n\n# Show the figure\nfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nUse the WebR cell below to fit a curve to your data, using geom_smooth().\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting figure has added a model curve, estimated using loess to the dataset for each medium (Figure 2.4). The coloured line shows the model fit, and the semitransparent ribbon shows the standard error (se) of the fit - an estimate of fit accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: A ggplot() graph of three growth curves, with growth medium indicated by colour and a best-fit loess curve.\n\n\n\nThis kind of curve tends to overfit the dataset, as might be seen by the tendency of the curve to “kick” up or down at the end of the graph. Generally-speaking, we should always try to fit a suitable model to our data, and loess is not necessarily the most suitable model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does that ribbom mean?\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will see that geom_smoot() has fitted a line (the model fit), and a semitransparent ribbon that looks like it might be describing error in your data.\nHowever, the ribbon isn’t describing error in your data - it’s describing error in the model fit. Many models fit your data more-or-less well, and the ribbon shows the extent of what models might fit well.\nMore technically, the ribbon shows the standard error of the model fit.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.4 Use a logarithmic \\(y\\)-axis\nIt is usual to draw growth curves using a logarithmic \\(y\\)-axis. There are a number of reasons for doing this, but the main one is that plotting OD on a linear \\(y\\)-axis is misleading about the start of the logarithmic phase of growth.\nThe beginning of logarithmic growth - though logarithmic - involves small changes in absolute OD that are not easy to distinguish on a linear scale. Plotting OD on a logarithmic scale makes it easier to identify the start of the log phase.\nTo set a logarithmic \\(y\\)-axis, we add a style layer: scale_y_log10()\n\nfig &lt;- ggplot(data, aes(x=time, y=OD600, color=medium)) +  # Declare the dataset/base layer\n         geom_point() + # Add a marker for each datapoint\n         geom_smooth() +  # Fit a default curve to the data\n         scale_y_log10()  # Make the y-axis logarithmic\n\nand, to make the graph easier to interpret we can add logarithmic \\(y\\)-axis ticks with the annotation_logticks() style layer:\n\nfig &lt;- ggplot(data, aes(x=time, y=OD600, color=medium)) +  # Declare the dataset/base layer\n         geom_point() + # Add a marker for each datapoint\n         geom_smooth() +  # Fit a default curve to the data\n         scale_y_log10() +  # Make the y-axis logarithmic\n         annotation_logticks(sides=\"l\")  # Add logarithmic y-axis ticks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nUse the WebR cell below to make the y-axis logarithmic and add logarithmic axis ticks.\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure (Figure 2.5) now has a logarithmic \\(y\\)-axis (and a linear \\(x\\)-axis, hence “semilog plot”), and it is clear that, compared to Figure 2.5, the logarithmic growth visibly starts earlier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: A ggplot() graph of three growth curves, with growth medium indicated by colour and a best-fit loess curve, using a logarithmic \\(y\\)-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.5 Making a monochrome plot\nThe plot looks pretty good just now but, for publication, we might want to make the plot black and white, or greyscale to suit a publisher’s requirements. There are three things we can do to make our plot publication-ready in this way.\nFirst, we need to set the colour scheme to greyscale. We can do this by adding the scale_colour_grey() style layer. Next, we change the overall ggplot2 theme to be black-and-white, with the theme_bw() style layer. Finally, we turn off the grid markings, with specific theme() style layer instructions. Putting these together, we get:\n\nfig &lt;- ggplot(data, aes(x=time, y=OD600, color=medium)) +  # Declare the dataset/base layer\n         geom_point() + # Add a marker for each datapoint\n         geom_smooth() +  # Fit a default curve to the data\n         scale_y_log10() +  # Make the y-axis logarithmic\n         annotation_logticks(sides=\"l\") + # Add logarithmic y-axis ticks\n         scale_colour_grey() +  # Convert colours to greyscale\n         theme_bw() +  # Make the theme black and white\n         theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n               panel.grid.minor = element_blank())  # Remove grid lines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nUse the WebR cell below to generate a black and white publication-ready plot.\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting figure (Figure 2.6) has replaced the colour scheme with greyscale, removed the gridlines, and changed the overall theme to black-and-white.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: A ggplot() graph of three growth curves, with growth medium indicated by grey level and a best-fit loess curve, plotted with a logarithmic \\(y\\)-axis.",

So we are looking for plasmids (here named pABS1.01 to pABS1.09) that have a strong expression response at high concentrations of kanamycin, but a weaker expression response at lower concentrations.\nTo find good candidate reporter systems, we plot the OD700/OD600 ratio against kanamycin concentration, to visualise which systems appear to have the characteristics we are looking for.",

    "text": "Caution\n\n\n\nIt is not enough to only measure the absorbance due to the reporter gene. We are interested in how much reporter gene is produced by each cell. So we must take into account how many cells are present in the medium.\nTo see what we mean: if 500 cells each produced 10 units of reporter gene, we’d expect around 5000 units of absorbance. But if there are only 100 cells producing 50 units of reporter gene each, we’d still expect around 5000 units of absorbance. Measuring OD700 alone could not tell the difference between these results.\nTo take the number of cells into account, we also measure absorbance at 600nm (OD600), as a measure of cell density. Then, by taking the ratio of OD700 to OD600 we can normalise the measurement of reporter gene by the amount of the organism that is present.\nWith our example above, assuming that one cell gives one unit of absorbance at 600nm, the situation with 500 cells producing 10 units of reporter gene each would have an OD700/OD600 ratio of \\(5000/500 = 10\\), but the case of 100 cells producing 50 units of reporter gene would have an OD700/OD600 ratio of \\(5000/100 = 50\\), for five times the expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn this part of the workshop, you will plot the ratio of your reporter absorbance (OD700) to your organism growth (OD600) against the concentration of kanamycin applied, using R, in order to identify good candidate reporters.",

Here, you will use facets to plot each sample separately in its own smaller subplot (called a facet). This will avoid the visualisation problems caused by overlapping lines with similar colours.\nTo do this, we use the facet_wrap() styling layer. We need to tell facet_wrap() what variable should be plotted in each separate facet.

    "text": "4.3 Things you can do\nThis WebR instance has three packages installed:\n\nggplot2\nGGally\ntidyverse\npalmerpenguins\n\nOpen the callout boxes below to see some examples you can try in the code cell above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigate Palmer’s Penguins\n\n\n\n\n\nThe penguins dataset contains data about three different species of penguins. Take a look at the format of the dataset:\nglimpse(penguins)\nYou’ll see there are eight variables, including species, weight, sex, etc. - some of these variables are categorical (i.e. a category, like species), and others are continuous (i.e. numerical). You can see a visual overview of how the data is related using the plot() function:\nplot(penguins)\nWe can visualise the number of penguins of each species in a bar chart:\nfig &lt;- ggplot(penguins, aes(species, fill=species)) +\n         geom_bar()\nfig\nAnd break this down in a facet plot, by sex:\nfig &lt;- ggplot(penguins, aes(species, fill=species)) +\n         geom_bar() +\n         facet_wrap(~sex)\nfig\nWe can make a box and whisker plot of penguin body mass by species:\nfig &lt;- ggplot(penguins, aes(x=species, y=body_mass_g, fill=species)) +\n         geom_boxplot()\nfig\nAnd plot the body mass for each sex side-by-side\nfig &lt;- ggplot(penguins, aes(x=species, y=body_mass_g, fill=sex)) +\n         geom_boxplot()\nfig\nWe can investigate correlations, such as between body mass and flipper length:\nfig &lt;- ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g, y=flipper_length_mm)) +\n         geom_point()\nfig\nWe can colour datapoints by species:\nfig &lt;- ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g, y=flipper_length_mm, colour=species)) +\n         geom_point()\nfig\nAnd fit a linear regression to each species separately:\nfig &lt;- ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g, y=flipper_length_mm, colour=species)) +\n         geom_point() +\n         geom_smooth(method=\"lm\")\nfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nR comes with a number of example datasets you can practice with, including:\n\nmtcars: fuel consumption and other statistic for 32 automobiles\nTitanic: information on the fate of passengers on the fatal maiden voyage of the ocean liner Titanic\n\nYou can see a full list by running the command\nlibrary(help = \"datasets\")",
