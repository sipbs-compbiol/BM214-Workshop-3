## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, students will be able to:

- explain that 16S sequences are commonly used for bacterial identification and taxonomic assignment
- describe and use two online tools for 16S sequence analysis: `BLAST` and `silva`
- interpret the output of `BLAST` and `silva` and positively identify an organism, or rule out an identification
- plot data from a microbial growth curve using `R` and `ggplot2`
- fit a curve to microbial growth data using `R` and `ggplot2`
- plot data from a reporter assay using `R` and `ggplot2`
- adjust and customise a figure using `R` and `ggplot2`

## Assessment

The workshop is not formally assessed although, as noted, all the material contained in the workshop is examinable. [**FILL TEXT HERE**]
