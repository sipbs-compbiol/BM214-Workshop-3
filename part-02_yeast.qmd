# Yeast Growth Experiment

As part of BM214 laboratories 2 and 3 (@fig-expt-3) you investigated strains of _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ that had been generated by random mutagenesis. In laboratory 2, you were provided with streak plates containing _S. cerevisiae_ strains, and set up cultures in liquid media:
  
- control
- supplememnted with glucose
- supplemented with lactose
  
These cultures were incubated for you, and in Laboratory 3 you measured their growth using a spectrophotometer.

In this part of the workshop, you will use `R` to plot growth curves for your strains interactively, in the browser.

## Use what you know from BM110 and BM211

You have met `R` before in the statistics component of BM110, and in an interactive exercise as [part of a BM211 workshop](https://sipbs-compbiol.github.io/BM211-workshops/shannon_index.html).

`R` can be used in several different ways - as a standalone program, within the `RStudio` environment or - as here - in a web browser. Full instructions for how to generate your figures are provided as part of the workshop.
